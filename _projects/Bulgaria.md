I saw this meme a while ago, and it totally blew my mind as to how I saw technology. I think that there's so much inside of us, in our soul, in our bodies, that needs to be heard, that cannot be heard, because we distract ourselves from external sources. And I think it's possible that we're generally afraid of what it is that is inside of us, so much so that we drown ourselves with our phones. Who knows if there is a castle full of mysteries and easter eggs only if you bother looking. 

And I wasn't happy with the amount of phone uses that I was doing, or having conversations that were not necessarily the most fulfilling or joyful. And I started to retrospect and ask myself this question that, should I keep doing this, or should I turn around? And that's why I figured one way to test myself and to test my faith to introspection was to give up any external stimulation, except journaling and coding. And I accept journaling in my work and my other work commitments, and go hard on this. And the reason I did that was because it was very necessary for me to look inwards. So, off I went to a Bulgarian rural village to live the life of a traditional wife.

I think this experiment entailed a few things:  I wasn’t allowed to use my phone till 8 PM except maybe 1-3 times to respond to messages from friends/family who wanted to be certain that I wasn’t kidnapped. I didn’t really have anyone to talk to besides my landlady Tsvetina who is an awesome person and really fun but ideally I aimed at just looking inwards to find out some deeper truths about my being.

I also didn’t really want to be memetically influenced by the life that I came from so over time I curbed the usage of reddit,instagram to less than 20 minutes. I did that by using an app on my browser and it worked surprizingly well. 

I replaced all th extra time I had with work and with starting at the mountians and laying down watching the sky while the warm sun light hits my face. Somehow this was cathartic and far more satsifying eventually. 

One of the main things I learned is that now I could sleep well. I could sleep for 8 hours straight for multiple days without using any sleep supplement and I think that was just such a surprising revelation. To be able to sleep so peacefully for so many nights back to back was just like, wow, like it was unreal. I had many years of insomnia and that was cured. I felt very relaxed from that one. I realized I didn't need my phone and I didn't need external information from other sources to entertain myself. I felt like I wasn't exactly gaining any knowledge from external sources that I used to frequent most of it was just an escape more than anything else. 

And Just like that, I think I ended my many years of Insomnia.
