The biggest fear today is watching your carefully constructed identity crumble as AI takes over tasks, leaving script kiddies to write your emails and make your calls. People often build their careers based on what’s currently trendy—today it’s the AI engineer, yesterday it was consulting, and tomorrow it will be something else entirely. The years spent building a career from scratch lead to an identity that’s hard to shake. If you’re smart and ambitious, you probably went all-in during the early stages, which now makes you feel threatened by AI.

Intelligent people who are not emotionally or socially aware can be easily fooled and driven insane. You just have to hand them an unsolvable Rubik’s cube(like a career) and convince them that it is the most important thing in the world. This will trigger their desire to be special, or their fear of being useless or bad, and they will not know this is happening, they’ll just tear their hair out trying to solve the unsolvable Rubik’s cube. 

This causes three issues: 

1. They get really good at completely pointless things and also become dangerously proud of it. 
2. They don’t actually learn the real skills(because of time wasted in 1) that will help make an impact/wealth/freedom that they are ultimately looking for to avoid that bitter existential crisis at 32. 
3. Your work lacks the nuance and problem solving skills necessary to make them adaptable to the changing AI landscape 

To avoid this pitfall  → Think of every “job” on two axis → Nuanced Problem solving and Utility where depending on your life phase utility both of those terms can have a very different meaning. 

Think of your sense of career fulfillment + the safety of your career = (problem solving * utility)

Your goal in life should be to iterate between different careers and jobs until you land on something that’s both highly nuanced problem solving  and high utility for you.

Nuanced Problem Solving → the more nuanced your problem the more difficult it is for AI to automate it

Utility → Coz you gotta make some money duH!!!

Now this  might require you to spend many months/years seemingly “lost” in the maze of what you are doing with you life and I think that’s perfectly okay. 

How do you know that you are on your path – because it disappears. That’s how you know. How do you know that you are really doing something radical? Because you can’t see where you are going. That’s how you know. And everything you have lent on for your identity has gone. And so you are going to enter the black contemplative splendours of self-doubt and maybe that’s okay.
