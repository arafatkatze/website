People often hit me up with a curious tone, asking how I manage to travel so much, how I handle the absurdity of bouncing from one place to another, living a life that seems like a never-ending adventure. And yeah, I’m incredibly grateful for this lifestyle. It’s one of endless exploration and constant discovery. But behind the Instagram-worthy moments and the stories of far-flung places, there’s a deeper truth—one that’s less glamorous and more complex.

I like to think of life as an equation:

**freedom * safety = constant**

It’s simple, really: the more freedom you chase, the more you chip away at your safety. The reverse is true, too. It’s not that one is better than the other; it’s about what you value more. For me, freedom has always been the priority—craving it like air, needing it to feel truly alive. But here’s the kicker: people often crave freedom without fully understanding the cost.

Imagine standing on the edge of a vast, open field, the horizon stretching out before you. Freedom feels like that endless expanse, inviting you to run, to explore, to lose yourself in the possibilities. But the further you run, the more you leave behind the comforts of safety—the familiar faces, the steady ground, the warmth of a fire you know will always be there.

This trade-off isn’t just a philosophical musing; it’s woven into the fabric of everyday life:

- **Guns / School Safety**: More guns might make you feel powerful, but they can turn a safe haven into a place of fear.
- **Vaccines / Longevity**: Skipping vaccines might seem like a way to maintain control over your body, but it could cost you years of life.
- **Living Off the Grid / Access to Help**: The allure of a remote cabin is undeniable, but twist an ankle out there, and you might be on your own.

But there’s something else—a quieter, more insidious cost that comes with the pursuit of freedom: **loneliness**.

The more you chase freedom and novelty, the rarer your experiences become. It’s like being the only one on a path that no one else dares to take. Founding a company, surviving a snowstorm in the middle of nowhere, or chasing those wild, unpredictable adventures that make life feel like a movie—these are experiences that few can relate to. And that’s where the loneliness seeps in.

You see, freedom might open up the skies, letting you soar high above the constraints of ordinary life, but it also often leaves you navigating through storms alone. The higher you fly, the fewer people there are who can keep up with you. Sure, Instagram influencers might show you the glamorous side of this lifestyle, but they don’t often talk about the cold winds of isolation that come with it, the quiet nights when you’re far from anyone who truly understands what you’re going through.

So here’s my advice: absolutely go for it. Chase the freedom, embrace the adventure, live the stories that will make you smile when you’re old and gray. But know what you’re signing up for. All the coolest things in life come with a side of risk, uncertainty, and yes, loneliness. If you want to score big, you’ve gotta be willing to step out of your comfort zone, roll the dice, and walk a path that not many will follow. That’s the price of having an independent mind.
