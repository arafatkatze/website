Hi,   

This is Ara. I find myself at the intersection of many things that entail art, love and beauty in all its forms. My primary expression of art is technology, I spend most of my days playing with AI to build beautiful things for others.


I really enjoy knowing more about the world and its complexity in deeper ways so I read and explore a lot. I hop between many different places. Recently, I had to send an application that required mentioning of all my addresses and turns out I had 17 addresses in the last 5 years. I have travelled to 21 and lived in 5 different countries and in many different provinces of Canada(The closest thing I have to a home). 

As a proud Canadian, I am a huge fan of nature. I have spent a lot of time hiking, skiing and snowboarding in the Rockies. I have learnt so much about beauty, love and friendship through the times I have spent in the mountains with my friends. I even had a few close encounters with death, but it all worked out in the end. 

I have a lot of socials and I am learning how to document and share more of life and thoughts with the world. You can check them out below:
